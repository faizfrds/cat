#hi this is my first PHP website i made. It is designed for a cat hotel

Web application for my school computer science project. It is about a cat hotel business. It uses MySQL to store data. If you want to open this web app, save this repo inside 'htdocs' of your XAMPP application and access it by typing 'localhost/cat-booking' in your browser.
