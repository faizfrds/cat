Web application for my school computer science project. It is about a cat hotel business. It uses MySQL to store data. If you want to open this web app, save this repo inside 'htdocs' of your XAMPP application and access it by typing 'localhost/cat-booking' in your browser. 

** Unfortunately, the MySQL database has not been saved, and therefore some data might not properly display. Watch the 'video of product' to gain insight into the product's functionality.
